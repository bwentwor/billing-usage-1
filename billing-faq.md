# FAQs for billing and usage
{: #billusagefaqs}

FAQs for billing and usage might include questions about credit cards, promo codes, or other billing-related issues. To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see our [FAQ library](https://{DomainName}/docs/faqs).
{: shortdesc}

## What is a GB-hour?
{: #gb-hour}
{: faq}

Runtime and container usage is charged based on the following variables:
 * How much memory your runtime or container uses, in gigabytes (GB).
 * The duration that memory is used.

Multiply the two values together, and the result is the GB-hour.

## What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
{: faq}

When you reach any quota for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended. Quotas are based per org and not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org show any usage from previous instances. The quota resets on the first of every month.

## Can I update my credit card?
{: #updatecard}
{: faq}
{: support}

Updating your credit card is just like adding a new one. Go to the [Payments](/billing/payments) page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. In the Add Payment Method section, enter the billing information for your new card, and click **Add credit card**.

To switch to a different payment method, select **Pay with Other**, and click **Submit change request**. A support case to change your payment method is then created for you. 

If your payments are managed outside of the console, go to IBM.com and log in to the Manage Payment Method application to update your credit card. For more information, see [How do I add a credit card when the option isn't available through the console?](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-ts_ccibm)

Some payment methods, such as PayPal, aren't accepted as recurring payment methods. You must manually submit the payment each month.

## Why won't my credit card go through?
{: #addcard}
{: faq}
